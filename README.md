## Installation

To run RSA, you'll have to install sympy, for which you need to install mpmath first.

Use pip/pip3 according to your python version
```
pip3 install mpmath
```
Then run
```
pip3 install sympy
```

**Note**: Make sure you install pycipher if you want to use Vigenere's cipher.

Use pip/pip3 according to your python version

```
pip3 install pycipher
```

## Running

1. Clone this directory
2. go to Terminal/ Command prompt
3. Traverse to the folder/directory where you've downloaded this folder to
4. Run the following command

```
python3 main.py
```
**Note**: Make if you're using ECC make sure you understand basic variable naming and method of solving because the output is very cluttered and might be difficult to navigate at times
